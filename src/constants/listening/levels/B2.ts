            level: "B2",
            content: "Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, encompassing everything from microscopic organisms to giant whales. Beyond its intrinsic beauty, biodiversity is essential for 'ecosystem services' that humans rely on for survival. These include the pollination of crops by insects, the purification of water by wetlands, and the regulation of the global climate by forests. Current rates of species extinction are alarmingly high, primarily due to habitat loss, climate change, and overexploitation of resources. Losing biodiversity means weakening the resilience of our planet's life-support systems. Protecting diverse habitats is therefore not just an ethical choice, but a practical necessity for human security.",
