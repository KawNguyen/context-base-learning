Traditional economic growth, measured by GDP, relies on the perpetual expansion of production and resource consumption, which appears fundamentally irreconcilable with the physical limits of the biosphere.

Furthermore, the global South often bears the brunt of environmental degradation caused by the consumption patterns of the North, leading to calls for 'climate justice.' Achieving true sustainability may require moving beyond growth-centric paradigms toward 'steady-state' or 'post-growth' economies focused on human well-being within planetary boundaries.",

Jean-Paul Sartre, a key figure, famously declared that 'existence precedes essence,' suggesting that humans are not born with a predefined purpose but must create their own through their choices and actions. This freedom, however, is often experienced as 'angst' or 'nausea'—the dizzying realization of our total responsibility in an indifferent world. Albert Camus explored this through the concept of 'the absurd'—the conflict between the human desire for meaning and the 'silent' universe. For existentialists, the ultimate challenge is to live 'authentically'—acknowledging the absurdity of existence while still asserting one's own values and meaning.",
