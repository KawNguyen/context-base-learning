While the 'strong' version of this theory—linguistic determinism—has been largely discredited, the 'weak' version remains a subject of intense academic inquiry. Proponents argue that lexical categories for color, space, and time can shape cognitive processing speeds and behavioral tendencies. For instance, speakers of languages with gendered nouns may attribute traditionally masculine or feminine qualities to inanimate objects. This intersection of linguistics and cognitive science challenges the notion of a universal, language-independent human experience.",
