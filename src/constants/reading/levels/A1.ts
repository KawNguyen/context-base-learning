    passage:
      "My name is Tom. I am ten years old and I live in a beautiful house in London. London is a very big and busy city in England with many parks and museums. I have blue eyes and brown hair. I am a student at a local primary school. I like to play football with my friends on the green grass after school. My favorite color is red because it is bright, happy, and it is also the color of my favorite football team's shirt. I have a small family. I have one sister, her name is Lucy. She is eight years old. Lucy is very creative and she likes to draw colorful pictures of animals and flowers. We go to the same school together every morning, and we play fun games at home in the evening. My mother is a kind teacher at a high school, and my father works in a modern office in the city center. We have a very cute pet dog named Max. He is black and white with a long tail. Max is very friendly and he likes to run fast. On weekends, my family and I often go to the big park near our house. Sometimes we visit my grandparents in the countryside. They have a big garden with many fruit trees. I want to be a doctor when I grow up because I want to help sick people and make them feel better.",

We always have dinner together every evening at seven o'clock. During dinner, we talk about our day, share funny stories, and plan for the next day. On Sundays, we usually go to the big park to have a picnic and play outdoor games like frisbee or catch. I feel very lucky to have such a wonderful family.",

      "I go to school from Monday to Friday every week. My school is not far from my house, so I usually walk there in the morning. My school starts at 8 am. I always wear my school uniform, which is blue and white. It makes me feel proud of my school. I have many good friends at school, and we always play together during the breaks. We study many interesting subjects such as Maths, English, Science, and Art. My favorite subject is Art because I love to be creative and draw pictures of nature. We have a big lunchroom where we eat lunch together at 12 pm. After school ends at 4 pm, I often stay for a little while to play football with my classmates before going home. School is a great place to learn and have fun with others.",

      "I have a very special pet dog at home. His name is Max, and he is three years old now. Max is a beautiful brown dog with a very soft coat. One of his most interesting features is his long, floppy ears that shake when he runs. Max is extremely playful and full of energy every day.\n\nEvery afternoon, I take Max to the local park near our house. He absolutely loves to run on the green grass and meet other dogs. My favorite game is when I throw a small tennis ball far away, and Max runs very fast to bring it back to me. He is very smart and always knows where the ball is. When we go home, Max is often hungry, so he eats a big bowl of delicious dog food. At night, he sleeps in a cozy small bed in the corner of my room. Max is not just a pet; he is my best friend and a part of our family. I love him very much and always take good care of him.",
