      "My name is Tom. I am ten years old and I live in a beautiful house in London. London is a very big and busy city in England with many parks and museums. I have blue eyes and brown hair. I am a student at a local primary school. I like to play football with my friends on the green grass after school. My favorite color is red because it is bright, happy, and it is also the color of my favorite football team's shirt. I have a small family. I have one sister, her name is Lucy. She is eight years old. Lucy is very creative and she likes to draw colorful pictures of animals and flowers. We go to the same school together every morning, and we play fun games at home in the evening. My mother is a kind teacher at a high school, and my father works in a modern office in the city center. We have a very cute pet dog named Max. He is black and white with a long tail. Max is very friendly and he likes to run fast. On weekends, my family and I often go to the big park near our house. Sometimes we visit my grandparents in the countryside. They have a big garden with many fruit trees. I want to be a doctor when I grow up because I want to help sick people and make them feel better.",
