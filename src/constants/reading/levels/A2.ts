    passage:
      "Last summer, I went on a truly memorable holiday to Spain with my family. We were all very excited as it was our first time visiting the Mediterranean region. We flew from London to Barcelona, which took about two hours. Upon arrival, we took a taxi to our hotel, which was located perfectly right next to the beautiful Barceloneta beach. The weather was absolutely ideal—hot and sunny every single day without a cloud in the sky. We spent a lot of time exploring the vibrant and artistic city. We visited many famous landmarks, including the stunning and unique Sagrada Familia and the colorful Park Güell, both masterpiece designs by Antoni Gaudí. One of the major highlights was definitely the food. I tried authentic seafood paella for the first time at a local restaurant, and the flavors were incredible. We also spent several relaxing afternoons swimming in the crystal-clear Mediterranean Sea and sunbathing on the golden sand. In the evenings, we enjoyed walking through the historic Gothic Quarter, which had many narrow, winding streets and charming little shops. It was truly the best holiday I've ever had because I got to spend quality time with my family while discovering a rich new culture.",

    passage:
      "I am currently planning an incredibly exciting trip to Japan for next year. I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture and history, so I want to visit at least three major cities: Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. Tokyo is a bustling, modern metropolis known for its towering skyscrapers, neon lights, and cutting-edge technology. I am looking forward to visiting the famous Shibuya Crossing and trying the latest gadgets. In contrast, Kyoto is the heart of traditional Japan, filled with beautiful temples, peaceful Zen gardens, and historic tea houses. I hope to see a geisha in the Gion district. Finally, I will head to Osaka, which is world-famous for its delicious street food and extensive shopping districts. I plan to fly from London to Tokyo and then use the high-speed bullet train, or Shinkansen, to travel between cities. To save money, I will stay in clean and friendly hostels along the way. I have already started learning some basic Japanese words and phrases to help me communicate better with the local people. Of course, I am eager to try authentic sushi and ramen. It will be an unforgettable adventure that I have been dreaming about for years.",

    passage:
      "My absolute favorite movie is 'The Shawshank Redemption', a powerful and moving drama which was released in 1994. The film is set in a harsh prison and tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker who is wrongly convicted of a crime he did not commit. He is sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. While inside, Andy develops a deep and lasting friendship with another prisoner named Ellis 'Red' Redding, who is a veteran inmate. Together, they navigate the difficult realities of prison life for many years. The film masterfully explores profound themes of hope, the strength of the human spirit, and the ultimate search for redemption. The performances are exceptional, particularly by Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, whose narration adds a beautiful layer to the story. The ending of the movie is incredibly emotional and features a surprising twist that always leaves me feeling inspired. It is such a classic and impactful story that I make sure to watch it at least once every year to remind myself of the importance of never losing hope, even in the darkest of times.",

      "Life as a high school teacher is quite busy, and my typical day starts very early. I usually wake up at 6 AM when the alarm goes off, and I immediately start preparing a healthy breakfast and a cup of coffee to get energized for the day ahead. I leave my house around 7 AM to ensure that I arrive at school by 7:30 AM, which gives me enough time to prepare my materials before classes officially begin at 8 AM. My primary job is teaching English to students of various ages and proficiency levels. No two classes are ever exactly the same, which keeps the work interesting. During the short breaks between lessons, I enjoy heading to the staff room to chat with my supportive colleagues and grab another quick coffee. Lunch is served in the school cafeteria at noon, providing a well-deserved break. After the students leave in the afternoon, my work continues as I grade piles of essays and carefully plan the lessons for the following days. I typically leave the school building around 4 PM, but I often think about my students' progress on the way home. While teaching can be physically and mentally tiring, witnessing my students learn and grow is immensely rewarding and makes all the hard work worthwhile.",

    passage:
      "Maintaining healthy eating habits is absolutely crucial for ensuring long-term physical well-being and high energy levels. Personally, I make a conscious effort to incorporate a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables into my meals every single day. I actively try to avoid processed junk food such as salty chips and sugary snacks because they often lead to energy crashes later in the day. Instead of drinking soda or other highly processed beverages, I prefer to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of plain water throughout the day. For my daily breakfast, I usually prepare a bowl of warm oatmeal topped with fresh berries or sliced bananas, which provides sustained energy for the morning. Lunch is typically a light and nutritious salad featuring grilled chicken and a variety of greens. For dinner, I often choose steamed fish accompanied by roasted vegetables like broccoli and carrots. Since I started focusing more on my diet, I have noticed that I feel significantly more energetic, focused, and physically strong. Investing in good nutrition is a simple choice that pays off every day.",

With financial security, people might pursue education or start businesses. Opponents, however, worry about the massive cost and potential tax increases.

      "The idea of a 4-day work week is gaining traction globally. Instead of the traditional 5-day, 40-hour week, employees work four days with no loss of pay. Trials in several countries have shown promising results. Productivity often stays the same or improves, as workers are more rested and focused. Employee well-being increases, with lower rates of burnout and stress. It also allows valuable time for family, hobbies, and personal chores. However, implementing it can be challenging for customer-facing businesses that need 24/7 coverage. Despite logistics, the shift represents a re-evaluation of work-life balance.",

Unlike celebrity endorsements, influencers effectively communicate with a niche audience who trust their opinions. This form of marketing feels more authentic to consumers than traditional ads. Brands collaborate with influencers on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok to reach younger demographics. Micro-influencers, with smaller but highly engaged followings, are becoming particularly valuable.

This lifestyle involves avoiding plastic packaging, buying second-hand, and making products at home.

    passage:
      "Vertical forests are high-rise buildings covered with trees and shrubs, designed to combat urban pollution and heat. The most famous example is the Bosco Verticale in Milan, Italy. These living facades absorb carbon dioxide, filter dust, and produce oxygen. They also provide habitat for birds and insects, increasing urban biodiversity. The vegetation acts as a temperature regulator, keeping the building cool in summer and warm in winter, thus saving energy. However, maintenance is complex, often requiring specialized 'flying gardeners' to prune the trees. Despite the cost, vertical forests represent a promising fusion of architecture and ecology.",

    passage:
      "Nomophobia, or 'no-mobile-phone phobia', is the fear of being without a mobile phone. As we become increasingly dependent on smartphones for communication, information, and entertainment, separation anxiety is rising. Symptoms include panic, sweating, and rapid heartbeat when a phone is lost or battery dies. It can disrupt sleep and face-to-face interactions. Experts suggest digital detoxes, where people consciously spend time offline, to combat this addiction. Setting boundaries, like no phones at the dinner table, can helps restore balance in our lives.",

Accommodations range from yurts and teepees to treehouses and eco-pods. This trend appeals to those who find camping too rugged or uncomfortable. It provides access to remote landscapes with the luxury of a hotel. However, purists argue that it removes the authentic challenge of surviving in the wild.

    passage:
      "Urban sprawl refers to the unrestricted growth in many urban areas of housing, commercial development, and roads over large expanses of land. It is often characterized by low-density planning and high reliance on automobiles. While it provides affordable housing and more space for families, it has significant negative effects. Sprawl increases traffic congestion, air pollution, and reliance on fossil fuels. It also leads to habitat loss for wildlife and loss of farmland. City planners are now advocating for 'smart growth' strategies that promote higher density and better public transport to combat sprawl.",

It represents a shift from being passive consumers to active creators. Community spaces called 'makerspaces' provide tools and equipment that might be too expensive for individuals. Here, people share knowledge and collaborate on projects ranging from robotics to woodworking. This movement fosters innovation, problem-solving, and entrepreneurship.

    passage:
      "Ghost kitchens, also known as cloud kitchens, are food preparation facilities that have no dining area for customers. They produce food solely for delivery. This model significantly reduces rental and staff costs compared to traditional restaurants. With the rise of food delivery apps like UberEats and DoorDash, ghost kitchens have exploded in popularity. A single facility can house multiple brands or cuisines. While efficient, they have been criticized for disconnecting food from the dining experience and contributing to gig economy labor issues. Nevertheless, they represent a major shift in the food service industry.",

    passage:
      "Upcycling is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, or unwanted products into new materials or products of better quality or environmental value. Unlike recycling, which often breaks down materials, upcycling creatively repurposes them. Examples include turning old storage pallets into furniture or using plastic bottles to make plant pots. This practice reduces the consumption of new raw materials and the volume of waste sent to landfills. It is popular in fashion and interior design. Upcycling adds value to old items and encourages creative thinking about waste.",
